## [BEGINNER CHALLENGES] Front-End Javascript
Use Polkadot-JS or the Front-End Template to write a web page (hosted on GitHub pages or similar) that displays information about the latest block on Kusama, Polkadot or any other Substrate-based chain. Bonus: include a component to search for a block by number (height) and/or hash.

## Usage

You can start the template in development mode to connect to a locally running node

```bash
yarn start
```

You can also build the app in production mode,

```bash
yarn build
```
and open `build/index.html` in your favorite browser.
